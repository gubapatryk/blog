For the dough:

- 2.5 cups flour – 380 g
- 1 stick of butter – 200 g
- 2 egg yolks
- 150 g vanilla homogenized cheese
- 0.5 cup powdered sugar – 80 g
- 1 tsp baking powder

For the apple filling:

- 1 kg of apples (about 5 medium apples)
- 2 tbsp water
- 1 tbsp honey or sugar
- 1 level tbsp cinnamon

Instructions:

To make the dough, place the flour, baking powder, and powdered sugar in a large bowl. Add the cream cheese and egg yolks, then cut the butter into pieces and add it as well. Knead everything together until you have a smooth dough - using your hands works best. Shape the dough into a ball, flatten it slightly, wrap it in plastic wrap or place it in a bag, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

While the dough is chilling, prepare the apple filling. Wash, peel, and quarter the apples. Remove the cores and slice the quarters into thin pieces. Place them in a pot with the honey or sugar and two tablespoons of water. Cook over medium heat, stirring with a wooden spoon, for no more than 10 minutes - just until the apples soften and begin to stick together. Stir in the cinnamon, mix well, and set aside to cool. Transferring the apples to a bowl helps them cool faster.

After 30 minutes, take the dough out of the fridge and divide it into two parts. Roll out one part slightly larger than your baking pan (ideally on a floured surface). Transfer the dough to a 26 cm round springform pan lined with baking paper. You can grease the pan with butter first to help the paper stick. Trim any excess dough hanging over the edges. Return the second half of the dough to the fridge.

Fill the base with the apple mixture, which can still be warm, and smooth the surface. Take the second half of the dough from the fridge, roll it out, and cut it into long strips. Arrange the strips on top of the pie to form a lattice pattern. If you have leftover dough, you can shape it into small cookies and bake them alongside the pie - they only need about 15 minutes.

Bake the pie in a preheated oven at 180°C (top/bottom heat) or 170°C (fan-assisted) for 50 minutes. You can remove it from the oven immediately after baking. Once cooled, dust with powdered sugar and enjoy.
